I used some grid and flex proprierties to assemble the landing page properly.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- https://fontawesome.com/ - This helped me to choose icons and transform them in fonts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
